The Force is what gives the Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. [Obi-Wan]
I don't trust the boy.. [Master Windu]
So be it.. Jedi. [The Emperor]
Luke.. help me take this mask off. [Darth Vader]
You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder. [Jabba Da Hutt]
Soooo.. You have sister.. [Darth Vader]
Luke:Your thoughts betray you Father. I feel the good in you. The Conflict. Vader:There is no Conflict. [Luke & Vader]
Luke, I am your father. [Darth Vader]
Halt! De wanna wonga! [Bib Fortuna]
Good luck.. you're gonna need it! [Han Solo]
A Jedi Knight?! Jeez I'm out of it for a little while and everyone gets delusions of grandieur. [Han Solo]
Impressive. Most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. [Darth Vader]
Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless. [Master Yoda]
Always in motion is the future. [Master Yoda]
Concentrate.. feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future.. the past. Old friends long gone. [Master Yoda]
A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. [Master Yoda]
No! Try not. Do.. or do not. There is no try. [Master Yoda]
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. [Obi-Wan]
Of course I know him.. he's me. I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since, oh, since before you were born. [Ben Kenobi]
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. [Han Solo]
The Force will be with you. Always. [Obi-Wan]
It's not wise to upset a Wookie. [Han Solo]
The force is with with you young Skywalker, but you're not a Jedi yet. [Darth Vader]
If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. [Obi-Wan]
I find your lack of faith disturbing.. [Darth Vader]
PL: I'd rather kiss a Wookie! HS: That can be arranged! [Leia & Han]
R2, i suggest a new strategy. Let the wookie win. [C-3PO]
Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering. [Master Yoda]
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. [Master Yoda]
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. [C-3PO]
A Jedi gains power through understanding and a Sith gains understanding through power. [Palpatine]
There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. [Han Solo]
R2-D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer. [C-3PO]
Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. [Obi-Wan]
Your eyes can deceive you, don't trust them. [Obi-Wan]
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? [Master Yoda]
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. [Han Solo]
PL:I love you. HS:I know. [Leia & Han]
Impressive. Most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well. [Darth Vader]
Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way? [Leia]
PL:Why, you stuck up.. half-witted.. scruffy-looking.. nerf-herder! HS:Who's scruffy-looking? [Leia & Han]
Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. [Master Yoda]
Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.. [Master Yoda]
Feel, dont think. Use your instincts. [Qui-Gon]
Your focus determines your reality. [Qui-Gon]
I will do what i must.. [Obi-Wan]
The Force can have a strong influence on a weak mind. [Obi-Wan]
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. [Darth Vader]
Aaaaaaaaaarrgh. [Chewbacca]
Beep, bee-beeep. [R2D2]
The Force will be with you, always. [Obi-Wan]
Use the Force, Luke! [Obi-Wan]
I have a very bad feeling about this! [Luke]
LS: I don't believe it. Yoda: That is why you fail. [Luke & Yoda]
Apology accepted, Captain Needa. [Darth Vader]
The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am. [Darth Vader]
L:Your overconfidence is your weakness. E:Your faith in your friends is yours. [Luke & Emperor]
Good! Use your aggresive feelings, boy. Let the hate flow through you. [Emperor]
As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station! [Emperor]
I'm very embarrassed, General Solo, but it seems you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. [C-3PO]
E: At last the Jedi are no more. Y: Not if anything to say about it I have. At an end your rule is and not short enough it was. [Emperor & Yoda]
A: I sense Dooku. OW: I sense a trap. [Anakin & Obi]
Who's the more foolish: the fool, or the fool who follows him? [Obi-Wan]
OW: He is in great danger. P: From Sith? OW: From himself. [Obi & Padme]
Y: If so powerful you are, why leave? E: You will not stop me! Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us! Y: Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be. As is your faith in the dark side of the force. [Yoda & Emperor]
A:I think we lost something.. OW: Not to worry, we are still flying half a ship! [Anakin & Obi-Wan]
(on blaster pistol) How uncivilized. [Obi-Wan]
I hate you! [Anakin]
A: What have I done? E: You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. [Anakin & Emperor]
GG:..And Anakin Skywalker, I was expecting someone of your reputation to be a little.. older. A:General Grievous, you're shorter than I expected. GG:Ahh, Jedi scum! [Grievous & Anakin]
A:My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count. D:Good. Twice the pride, double the fall. [Anakin & Dooku]
Very dangerous putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it.. [Master Windu]
To become one with the Force, and influence still have.. A power greater than all, it is. [Master Yoda]
So this is how liberty dies.. with thunderous applause. [Padme]
(to R2) Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease. [C-3PO]
C-3:Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1. HS:Never tell me the odds. [C-3PO & Han Solo]
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum! Fearless and inventive! [Jabba Da Hutt]
That's no moon. It's a space station. [Obi-Wan]
DrE:You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence on twelve systems. L:I'll be careful. DrE:You'll be dead! [Luke & Dr.Evazan]
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. [Lucas]
This is Red 5, I'm going in. [Luke]
Yahoooo! You're all clear kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home. [Han Solo]
You don't need to see his identification .. These aren't the droids you're looking for .. He can go about his business .. Move along. [Obi-Wan]
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being. [Han Solo]
Y:Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you. D:I have become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you. Y:Much to learn, you still have. [Yoda & Dooku]
W:In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor. E:Are you threatening me, Master Jedi? [Windu & Emperor]
Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing.. how embarrassing. [Master Yoda]
You must face Darth Vader again. [Obi-Wan]
W:The Senate will decide your fate. E:I am the Senate! W:Not yet! E:It's treason, then. [Windu & Emperor]
Go to the center of the gravity's pull, and find your planet you will. [Master Yoda]
Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? [Han Solo]
Look, good against remotes is one thing, good against the living, that's something else. [Han Solo]
Wipe them out, all of them. [Emperor]
The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get out of here. [Qui-Gon]
This party's over! [Master Windu]
There is always a bigger fish. [Qui-Gon]
L:Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. Y:No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. [Luke & Yoda]
May the Force be with You! [StarWars]
